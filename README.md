# TCEL
TCEL is a C library that adds dynamic arrays and other stuff to C.

This is mainly for use in my other projects, but if you know of anything that could be added, please let me know.

## Getting started
```lua
---Heres how you should use it
tcel_include_tests = false
--Replace TCEL with the appropriate path
doborz("TCEL")
```
In the future you shouldn't need to define if tests should be included or not, but for now you do.
